## Task 1:  Linked Lists
### 1) Single Linked lists



### Hints and stuff

- Hint: you may already find code for invoking the methods in the compact class _main.java_.  More information on compact class in java25 here: https://openjdk.org/jeps/512

- Optional: To test your code, you will find the test setup in the file `src/test/java/assignment/TestAssignment.java`. There you can choose to run all tests at once or run them one by one. This requires that maven JUNIT 6 is installed: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/junit.html

- Solution: You can find a solution proposal i the `src/main/java/solution` folder.
