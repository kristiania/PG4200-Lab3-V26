# Lab practice 2

--------

## Task 1:  Array operations
### 1) Reverse Traverse 

- In this folder (`src/main/java/assignment`), create a class named _Traverse_ which will initially only have declared one int array variable.


- Create a constructor inside the _Traverse_ class with one parameter of type int [] for setting the instance variable.


- Create a method _inReverse_ that returns a copy of the instance variable in reverse ordering (from N to 0). 

### 2) Insert an element in an array.

- In this folder (`src/main/java/assignment`), create a class named _Insert_ which will initially only have declared one int array variable.


- Create a constructor inside the _Insert_ class with one parameter of type int [] for setting the instance variable.


#### Insert an element at the starting array index


- Create a method _atStart_ that  inserts a given value at the _beginning_ of an array and returns the resulting array.




#### Insert an element at the ending array index

- Create a method _atEnd_ that  inserts a given value at the _end_ of an array and returns the resulting array.


#### Insert an element at a specified array index

- Create a method _atIndex_ that  inserts a given value at the given index of an array and returns the resulting array.


#### Extra: refactor your code

- refactor (rewrite) your code in such a way that both methods _atStart_ and _atEnd_ invoke your method _atIndex_.

### 3) Delete an element in an array.


- In this folder (`src/main/java/assignment`), create a class named _Delete_ which will initially only have declared one int array variable.


- Create a constructor inside the _Delete_ class with one parameter of type int [] for setting the instance variable.


#### Delete the element at the starting array index


- Create a method _atStart_ that  deletes the element at the _beginning_ of an array and returns the resulting array.


#### Delete the  element at the ending array index

- Create a method _atEnd_ that  deletes the element at the _end_ of an array and returns the resulting array.


#### Delete the element at a specified array index

- Create a method _atIndex_ that  deletes the element at the given index of an array and returns the resulting array.


#### Extra: refactor your code

- refactor (rewrite) your code in such a way that both methods _atStart_ and _atEnd_ invoke your method _atIndex_.

- would have been much easier to begin with method _atIndex_ , wouldnt it?

### Hints and stuff

- Hint: you may already find code for constructing a _Traverse_- , _Insert_ and _Delete_-objects and invoking the methods in the compact class _main.java_.  More information on compact class in java25 here: https://openjdk.org/jeps/512

- Optional: To test your code, you will find the test setup in the file `src/test/java/assignment/TestAssignment.java`. There you can choose to run all tests at once or run them one by one. This requires that maven JUNIT 6 is installed: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/junit.html

- Solution: You can find a solution proposal i the `src/main/java/solution` folder.
